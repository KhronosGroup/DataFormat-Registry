data descriptor or that analysis of the data format descriptor will be
on a critical path in an application, it is still expected that comparison
between formats may be time-sensitive. The data format descriptor is designed
to allow relatively efficient queries for subsets of properties, to allow
a large number of format descriptors to be stored, and to be amenable to
hardware interpretation or processing in shaders. These goals preclude a
text-based representation such as an XML schema.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_why_not_use_an_existing_representation_such_as_those_on_fourcc_org"></a>9.2. Why not use an existing representation such as those on FourCC.org?</h3></div></div></div><p>Formats in FourCC.org do not describe in detail sufficient information for
many APIs, and are sometimes inconsistent.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_why_have_a_descriptive_format"></a>9.3. Why have a descriptive format?</h3></div></div></div><p>Enumerations are fast and easy to process, but are limited in that any
software can only be aware of the enumeration values in place when it
was defined. Software often behaves differently according to properties
of a format, and must perform a look-up on the enumeration — if it knows
what it is — in order to change behaviours. A descriptive format allows
for more flexible software which can support a wide range of formats
without needing each to be listed, and simplifies the programming of
conditional behaviour based on format properties.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_why_describe_this_standard_within_khronos"></a>9.4. Why describe this standard within Khronos?</h3></div></div></div><p>Khronos supports multiple standards that have a range of internal data
representations. There is no requirement that this standard be used
specifically with other Khronos standards, but it is hoped that multiple
Khronos standards may use this specification as part of a consistent
approach to inter-standard operation.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_why_should_i_use_this_format_if_i_don_8217_t_need_most_of_the_fields"></a>9.5. Why should I use this format if I don’t need most of the fields?</h3></div></div></div><p>While a library may not use all the data provided in the data format
descriptor that is described within this standard, it is common for
users of data — particularly pixel-like data — to have additional
requirements. Capturing these requirements portably reduces the need
for additional metadata to be associated with a proprietary descriptor.
It is also common for additional functionality to be added retrospectively
to existing libraries — for example, <span class="emphasis"><em>Y′C<sub>B</sub>C<sub>R</sub></em></span> support is often an
afterthought in rendering APIs.
Having a consistent and flexible representation in place from the start
can reduce the pain of retrofitting this functionality.</p><p>Note that there is no expectation that the format descriptor from this
standard be used directly, although it can be. The impact of providing
a mapping between internal formats and format descriptors is expected
to be low, but offers the opportunity both for simplified access from
software outside the proprietary library and for reducing the effort
needed to provide a complete, unambiguous and accurate description of a
format in human-readable terms.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_why_not_expand_each_field_out_to_be_integer_for_ease_of_decoding"></a>9.6. Why not expand each field out to be integer for ease of decoding?</h3></div></div></div><p>There is a trade-off between size and decoding effort. It is assumed
that data which occupies the same 32-bit word may need to be tested
concurrently, reducing the cost of comparisons. When transferring
data formats, the packing reduces the overhead. Within these constraints,
it is intended that most data can be extracted with low-cost operations,
typically being byte-aligned (other than sample flags) and with the
natural alignment applied to multi-byte quantities.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_can_this_descriptor_be_used_for_text_content"></a>9.7. Can this descriptor be used for text content?</h3></div></div></div><p>For simple ASCII content, there is no reason that plain text could not be
described in some way, and this may be useful for image formats that contain
comment sections. However, since many multilingual text representations
do not have a fixed character size, this use is not seen as an obvious match
for this standard.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
