independent of the layout and dimensionality of the collective data. Collections
of data may have a “compatible format” in that their format descriptor may be
identical, yet be different sizes. Some additional information is therefore
expected to be recorded alongside the “format description”.</p><p>The API which controls the bulk data is responsible for controlling which memory
location corresponds to the indexing mechanism chosen. A texel block has the
concept of a coordinate offset within the block, which implies that if the data
is accessed in terms of spatial coordinates, a texel block has spatial locality
as well as referring to contiguous memory (per plane). For texel blocks which
represent only a single spatial location, this is irrelevant; for block-based
compression, for formats with downsampled channels, or for Bayer-like formats, the
texel block represents a finite extent in up to four dimensions. However, the mapping
from coordinate system to the memory location containing a texel block is beyond the
control of this API.</p><p>The minimum requirements for accessing a linearly-addressed buffer is to
store the start address and a stride (typically in bytes) between texels in
each dimension of the buffer, for each plane contributing to the texel block.
For the first dimension, the memory stride between texels may simply be the
byte size of texel block in that plane — this implies that there are no
gaps between texel blocks. For other dimensions, the stride is a function
of the size of the data structure being represented — for example, in a compact
representation of a two-dimensional buffer, the texel block at coordinate (<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>,<span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>+1)
might be found at the address of coordinate (<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>,<span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>) plus the buffer width multiplied
by the texel size in bytes. Similarly in a three-dimensional buffer, the address
of the pixel at (<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>,<span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>,<span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>+1) may be at the address of (<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>,<span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>,<span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>) plus the byte size of
a two-dimensional slice of the texture. In practice, even linear layouts may have
padding, and often more complex relationships between coordinates and memory
location are used to encourage locality of reference. The details of all of these
data structures are beyond the remit of this specification.</p><p>Most simple formats contain a single <span class="emphasis"><em>plane</em></span> of data. Those formats
which require additional planes compared with a conventional representation
are typically downsampled <span class="emphasis"><em>Y′C<sub>B</sub>C<sub>R</sub></em></span> formats, which already
have the concept of separate storage for different color channels.
While this specification uses multiple planes to describe texel
blocks that span multiple scan lines if the data is disjoint, there is
no expectation that the API using the data formats needs to maintain
this representation — interleaved planes should be easy to identify
and coalesce if the API requires a more conventional representation of
downsampled formats.</p><p>Some image representations are composed of tiles of texels which are
held contiguously in memory, with the texels within the tile stored in
some order that improves locality of reference for multi-dimensional
access. This is a common approach to improve memory efficiency when
texturing. While it is possible to represent such a tile as a large
texel block (up to the maximum representable texel block size in this
specification), this is unlikely to be an efficient approach, since
a large number of samples will be needed and the layout of a tile
usually has a very limited number of possibilities. In most cases,
the layout of texels within the tile should be described by whatever
interface is aware of image-specific information such as size and stride,
and only the format of the texels should be described by a format descriptor.</p><p>The complication to this is where texel blocks larger than a single pixel
are themselves encoded using proprietary tiling. The spatial layout of
samples within a texel block is required to be fixed in the basic format
descriptor — for example, if the texel block size is 2×2 pixels, the
top left pixel might always be expected to be in the first byte in that
texel block. In some proprietary memory tiling formats, such as ones
that store small rectangular blocks in raster order in consecutive bytes
or in Morton order, this relationship may be preserved, and the only proprietary
operation is finding the start of the texel block. In other proprietary
layouts such as Hilbert curver order, or when the texel block size does
not divide the tiling size, a direct representation of memory may be
impossible. In these cases, it is likely that this data format standard
would be used to describe the data as it would be seen in a linear format,
and the mapping from coordinates to memory would have to be hidden in
proprietary translation. As a logical format description, this is unlikely
to be critical, since any software which accesses such a layout will
necessarily need proprietary knowledge anyway.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
