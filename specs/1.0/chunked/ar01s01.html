composed of many elements with a fixed and often simple representation.
Frequently, multiple alternative representations of data are supported:
vertices can be represented with different numbers of dimensions,
textures may have different bit depths and channel orders, and so on.
Sometimes the representation of the data is highly specific to the
application, but there are many types of data that are common to multiple
APIs — and these can reasonably be described in a portable manner. In
this standard, the term <span class="emphasis"><em>data format</em></span> describes the representation of
data.</p><p>It is typical for each API to define its own enumeration of the
data formats on which it can operate. This causes a problem when
multiple APIs are in use: the representations are likely to be
incompatible, even where the capabilities intersect. When additional
format-specific capabilities are added to an API which was designed
without them, the description of the data representation often
becomes inconsistent and disjoint. Concepts that are unimportant to the
core design of an API may be represented simplistically or inaccurately,
which can be a problem as the API is enhanced or when data is shared.</p><p>Some APIs do not have a strict definition of how to interpret their
data. For example, a rendering API may treat all color channels of
a texture identically, leaving the interpretation of each channel to
the user’s choice of convention. This may be true even if color channels
are given names that are associated with actual colors — in some APIs,
nothing stops the user from storing the blue quantity in the red channel
and the red quantity in the blue channel. Without enforcing a single
data interpretation on such APIs, it is nonetheless often useful to offer
a clear definition of the color interpretation convention that is in force,
both for code maintenance and for communication with external APIs which do
have a defined intepretation. Should the user wish to use an unconventional
interpretation of the data, an appropriate descriptor can be defined that
is specific to this choice, in order to simplify automated interpretation
of the chosen representation and to provide concise documentation.</p><p>Where multiple APIs are in use, relying on an API-specific representation
as an intermediary can cause loss of important information. For example,
a camera API may associate color space information with a captured image,
and a printer API may be able to operate with that color space, but if the
data is passed through an intermediate compute API for processing and that
API has no concept of a color space, the useful information may be discarded.</p><p>The intent of this standard is to provide a common, consistent, machine-readable
way to describe those data formats which are amenable to non-proprietary
representation. This standard provides a portable means of storing the most
common descriptive information associated with data formats, and an extension
mechanism that can be used when this common functionality must be supplemented.</p><p>While this standard is intended to support the description of many kinds of
data, the most common class of bulk data used in Khronos standards represents
color information. For this reason, the range of standard color representations
used in Khronos standards is diverse, and a significant portion of this
specification is devoted to color formats.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
